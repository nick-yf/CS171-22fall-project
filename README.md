# CS171-22fall-project
This is the final project of the course CS171 in 2022 Fall.

An executable for Linux is placed in the main directory of the project, to run the executable
```shell
./main
```
If the executable fails, you can also use `CMake` to build the project by yourself. The `CMakeList.txt` is also placed in the main directory of the project.
